  youtube_description: "Professor Hal Abelson has been active in computer science\
    \ for over half a century\u2014the first computer he worked with, in high school,\
    \ was the kind where programs were encoded in a pattern of holes punched into\
    \ a paper tape fed into the machine. When he arrived at MIT as a graduate student\
    \ in the late 1960s, Abelson became involved in exploring computers\u2019 potential\
    \ as educational tools. One of his first projects, under the guidance of Prof.\
    \ Seymour Papert, involved working to create a graphics display for use with the\
    \ Logo programming language, which had first been introduced to schoolkids just\
    \ a year or two earlier. In this episode, Prof. Abelson reminisces about those\
    \ early experiences and discusses the importance of computer education for everyone\u2013\
    including, and especially, for children who have the power to make real-world\
    \ impact through their programming work. He also weighs in on the risks associated\
    \ with artificial intelligence, and describes his involvement in MIT\u2019s decision\
    \ to give away educational materials online for free\u2014an initiative that ultimately\
    \ became MIT OpenCourseWare. Fundamentally, Prof. Abelson believes that computer\
    \ scientists need to confront not only the technical challenges of designing new\
    \ systems or applications, but also a deeper, humanistic question: \u201CWhat,\
    \ in fact, is worth making?\u201D"
